## About Me

Welcome to my website for the Distributed Research Apprenticeships for Master’s (DREAM) program! I'm Charlotte Anderson, currently pursuing a Master’s degree in data science at DePaul University, with an expected graduation in June 2024. My research interests encompass fog computing, machine learning, and computational methods. Through the DREAM program, I am gaining valuable hands-on research experience. Previously, I earned a bachelor’s degree in finance from DePaul University in 2023, where I also gained experience in accounting, corporate finance, and equity research. I seamlessly transitioned to my master's degree immediately after graduating.

## About My Project

This project aims to develop a priority-based user request management system using fog computing and machine learning techniques. By integrating machine learning models, the system will dynamically prioritize user requests based on their criticality, ensuring efficient resource allocation and timely responses. Embedding techniques will be used to transform textual data into numerical vectors, facilitating clustering and classification of user requests. The proposed solution will enhance the performance of fog computing environments, particularly for critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare monitoring, and smart cities.
