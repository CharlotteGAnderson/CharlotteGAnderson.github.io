## Week 5 (7/15 - 7/21)

This week, I started laying the foundation for my code by organizing and outlining the various functions needed for the project. I made sure to include my original network design, which is central to the project's structure. Alongside this, I contributed new healthcare ideas that will integrate with the code, ensuring that the project remains aligned with its healthcare focus. This groundwork is crucial as it sets the stage for the more complex development tasks ahead. The combination of coding foundations and healthcare insights is bringing the project closer to its intended goals.
