## Week 7 (7/29 - 8/04)

This week, I completed the first real simulation run-through for my code, marking a crucial step forward in the project. The simulation helped me identify key areas that need refinement, and I'm eager to optimize the code further. I also began drafting a rough outline for the final report, which will serve as the foundation for the documentation phase. This initial draft is helping me organize my thoughts and ensure that all critical aspects of the project are covered.

In addition to my coding progress, we had a cohort meeting where Dr. Frank Li kindly served as our guest speaker. He provided valuable insights into the different positions and roles within research environments, both in universities and companies. His advice on understanding these roles and how they interact was particularly helpful for navigating my own research journey. The meeting was both informative and inspiring, offering new perspectives that I plan to integrate into my project.
