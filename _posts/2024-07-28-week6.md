## Week 6 (7/22 - 7/8)

This week, I explored the healthcare field in search of appropriate datasets to support my project. However, I encountered a significant challenge: the available datasets required ethical certifications to handle the sensitive data I needed. Since obtaining these certifications wasn't feasible within my project timeline, I had to pivot and find a way to generate the necessary data myself. This was an unexpected hurdle, but it's pushing me to develop new strategies and solutions to keep the project on track.
