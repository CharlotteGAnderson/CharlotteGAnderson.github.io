## Week 4 (7/8 - 7/14)

This week, I focused on foundational research and drafted an official proposal for Dr. Siasi, which outlines my project's objectives and scope. I also created my first flowcharts, helping me visualize key processes and frameworks. To enhance my technical capabilities, I began building on my prior knowledge of Python, which will be essential for data analysis and automation. I decided to steer my project toward healthcare initiatives, inspired by extensive research on existing studies. This led to the creation of a healthcare-focused problem statement, which will guide the project's direction. Overall, Iâ€™ve made significant progress and am excited to continue building on this momentum.
