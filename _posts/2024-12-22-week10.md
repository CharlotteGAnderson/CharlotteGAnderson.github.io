title: Week 10 (12/22 - 12/31)
---

This week, I dedicated my efforts to refining the rough draft for the DREAM project report in Overleaf. I expanded on key sections, including the methodology and introduction, to provide a more comprehensive overview of the project’s scope and goals. Additionally, I began drafting the results section to outline the preliminary findings and their implications.

The Overleaf template has been an excellent tool for structuring the document, and it has helped streamline the writing process. I’m grateful for the opportunity to focus on documenting the progress made so far and organizing the material in a clear, professional format.

A heartfelt thank you to Dr. Siasi and the CRA for their continued support, which has been instrumental in advancing this project. Dr. Siasi's guidance and resources are invaluable in enabling meaningful contributions to the DREAM initiative.

Looking ahead, I plan to polish the draft further and start preparing supplementary materials to support the report.
