## Week 8 (8/04 - 8/11)

This week, I had to adjust the time stamps for inputs in my code to ensure accuracy and synchronization. Additionally, I contributed updates to the pseudo code and flowcharts, refining them to better align with the requirements of my final paper. These updates are crucial for clarifying the project’s methodology and improving the overall structure. As I worked on these adjustments, I made sure that everything was clearly documented to support the final report. The refinements are helping to solidify the project’s framework and prepare it for the next stages of development.
