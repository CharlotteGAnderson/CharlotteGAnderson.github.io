title: Week 9 (6/17 - 6/23)
---

This week, I focused on finalizing the code for the project. I made edits to specify the example usage of the hospital network under varying CPU and edge constraints. Different input scenarios were tested to ensure the queue system operated correctly.

Additionally, I collaborated with Dr. Siasi to gain access to the university's GPU, as my computer couldn't handle the computational demands. This access allowed me to effectively run the code under the required constraints, significantly improving processing efficiency.

On the documentation front, I began drafting the rough version of the project report using the Overleaf template. Setting up the Overleaf environment involved customizing the template to fit the projectâ€™s structure and requirements. I outlined the initial sections, including the introduction, methodology, and preliminary results. This draft will serve as a foundation for more detailed write-ups and will be continuously updated as the project progresses.

Overall, it was a productive week balancing both coding refinements and documentation efforts to ensure comprehensive project development.
